### test case file names
#### for eg:if you have a Nav component
* Nav.test.js
* Nav.test.ts
* Nav.spec.js
* Nav.spec.ts
***
## So what ever you want to test you have to put it in side __tests__ folder and use the syntax mention above **sum.text.js** 
### then inside that sum we write a like this 
**test(" first a string , add what everhere ",()=>{**
      const result=sum(2,4)  // over here sum component is imported overhere and this function just add two number.
      _assurtion_
      expect(result).toBe(6)
**})**
